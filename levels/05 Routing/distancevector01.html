<p>In <strong>dynamic</strong> routing, routers build their routing tables based on the knowledge
  they have about neighbor's links. Those links now have a <strong>cost</strong>, reflecting a measure of
  distance/bandwidth/delay between nodes. In <strong>distance vector</strong> algorithms, the router
    algorithm is basically <em>tell your neighbors when you know about everyone</em>.
    <!--<li>Link state algorithms: tell everyone what you know about your neighbors</li>-->
<p> In this level, three routers automatically exchange their distance vector tables and build
  their routing tables this way. The topleft router is manual and disabled when the simulation starts.
  Leave it disabled and first observe how routers exchange information and build their tables, and also
   when they decide to stop.

<p> Next reload (F5) the simulation (to destroy router's tables, not done yet) and activate the manual router.
  Start by filling its Distance Vector table with its 2 neighbors (Charlie and Router 1), and then you will have
  to reply to the successive packets sent by others routers by updating your DV table. Building the routing table
  and sending packets is done automatically when you update the DV table.

<p>Then try to send a ping packet from Charlie to Carol.

<p><it>Tip: to update the DV table, you must add new device entries coming from other routers (adding the link cost
  to other router costs)
  or modify the existing entries if their new cost (other cost + link cost) is less than your current cost.

<h3>Level Objectives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>note on a paper router names, port numbers and link costs</li>
  <li>reload the level and activate the topleft router</li>
  <li>update the Distance Vector table of the topleft router when required
  <li>when done send a ping packet from <strong>Charlie</strong> to <strong>Carol</strong></li>
</ul>
