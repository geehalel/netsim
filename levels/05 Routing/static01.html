<p>In previous levels, we saw that computers are usually connected through a series of <strong>routers</strong>.
When a router receives a <strong>packet</strong>, it looks at the destination in the dstip header of the packet,
and chooses the route that is closest to the destination computer using a <strong>routing table</strong>. The route
is given by a <strong>port number</strong> in this table, a router port being connected to a particular <strong>link</strong>
in the network.
<p>Pause the simulation and look at each router. You are now able to see and edit their routing tables. These are made of rules (
  one rule per line in the table), each rule associates a destination address <code>dstip</code> to a router port number <code>portNum</code>.
   Also use connector icon on links to visualize the port numbers where links are connected on the routers.
<p>In this level, we just add Charlie's computer and its router <code>Router 4</code> with an almost empty routing table.
  Try to send a packet from Charlie to Carol and observe the response made by <code>Router 4</code>.
  In the same way you may try to send a packet from Carol to Charlie.

<p>To pass this level, you have to edit the routing tables to send a ping packet from Charlie's computer to Carol's computer.
  Remember that ping packets are those with proto header set to ICMP. To edit the routing tables, use the add rule icon near the
  table header, or use the delete icon near a particular rule to delete that rule. Manually editing the routing tables is known
  as <strong>Static routing</strong>.
